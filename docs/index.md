## 🌳 What is The Magnum OAKus?

The definitive guide to Apache Oak repository operations, born from years of production incident response and deep architectural understanding.

::: danger 🎯 SCOPE
This guide requires direct filesystem access to the repository.

**Not for AEMaaCS**
:::

**This guide will help you:**

- 🚨 **Recover from corruption** - Step-by-step procedures for every scenario
- 🏗️ **Understand the architecture** - Know why recovery works (or doesn't)
- ⚡ **Optimize performance** - Compaction, checkpoints, and disk management
- 🔍 **Diagnose issues** - Tools and techniques for root cause analysis

## ⚠️ Critical Reality Check

> **Repository corruption scenarios fall into three categories:**
>
> 1. **Recoverable** - Good revision found by `oak-run check` ✅
> 2. **Partially Recoverable** - Check completes but finds "no good revision" ⚠️
> 3. **Unrecoverable** - Check fails completely with SegmentNotFoundException ❌
>
> **If you have a recent, tested backup: RESTORE IT NOW.** Stop reading. Don't run diagnostics. Every minute spent "investigating" is wasted time when you have a guaranteed good state.

## 📖 About This Guide

Originally authored for Adobe Customer Support, The Magnum OAKus represents thousands of hours of production incident response distilled into actionable procedures.

**Scope:**

| ✅ Applicable | ❌ Not Applicable |
|--------------|------------------|
| SegmentStore (TarMK) | AEMaaCS |
| DocumentNodeStore (MongoMK/RDB) | Cloud-native persistence |
| Direct filesystem access | Abstracted repository layer |

**Version Context:**
- Oak 1.22+ (AEM 6.4+) through Oak 1.60+ (AEM 6.5.20+)
- Procedures tested primarily on AEM 6.5.x with Oak 1.40-1.60
- Some behaviors differ in older Oak versions — check release notes

**Philosophy:**
- **Backup-first** - The only guaranteed recovery method
- **Understand before acting** - Know why procedures work
- **Time-bounded decisions** - When in doubt, restore from backup
